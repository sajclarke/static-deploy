In the event that the Price Information is not updated, for reasons of volatility or any other reason: (a) the Portal may change to a different designated independent Price Information feed or may establish manually a reasonable good faith current price that shall constitute the Price Information, until such time as the original Price Information can be queried and updated; or (b) if such non-updated state continues for any period of time of six hours or more, then any STO purchase transactions received after that time limit involving the subject currency or cryptocurrency will not be completed.</p><li>Disclaimers and Limitations of Liability</li><p class=text-danger>Provision of access to Price Information and associated currency conversion calculations as part of the Services provided through the Portal does not constitute an advertisement, solicitation, negotiation, offer, acceptance or any other involvement by Polymath Studios as an agent or intermediary in any STO.
